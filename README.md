Throughout the certification, I:

1. Mastered API Concepts: Developed a strong understanding of RESTful APIs, HTTP methods, and how to utilize Postman to interact with different API endpoints effectively.
2. Built and Tested API Requests: Gained hands-on experience in creating and configuring API requests using Postmanâ€™s interface and features like parameters, headers, and authorization.
3. Automated Testing: Learned to create and execute automated test scripts to validate API responses, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of APIs.
4. Documentation and Collaboration: Acquired skills in documenting APIs and utilizing Postmanâ€™s collaboration features to share API collections and work collaboratively with teams.
5. Advanced Features: Explored Postmanâ€™s advanced features such as mock servers, monitors, and workflows to simulate API behavior and manage API projects.

This certification has significantly improved my capabilities in API development and testing, enabling me to effectively design, test, and document APIs for various projects.
